plot-vowels-R
=============

Vowel plotting scripts written in R.  These functions will eventually be collected into a package.  The biggest barrier to entry to using the plotting function is its reliance on the R library "Cairo", which in turn depends on the Cairo graphics backend.  Installing Cairo is fairly easy on Linux machines, but less so for Mac and especially Windows machines.  To that end, an "installing Cairo" tutorial is also included.
